Student Exam Result Predictor

This repository contains Python code for a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on their attendance and study hours. The model is implemented using a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset includes features such as attendance ("good" or "bad") and study hours, which are mapped to numerical values for model training.
Model Training: The code splits the dataset into training and testing sets, builds a Decision Tree Classifier model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics.
Model Application: The trained model can be used to make predictions for new data, such as predicting the exam result for a student with given attendance and study hours.
